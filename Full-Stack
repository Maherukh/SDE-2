# Full stack 
Short answer: You’re close, but for Google SDE2 you need a higher bar on algorithms speed/coverage, deeper systems design, and fluency in a Google interview language (Java, C++ or Go). Your 36‑week plan is an excellent full‑stack track. Add the deltas below to convert it into an SDE2‑ready plan.

What to add or tighten (delta to your plan)

Interview language

Pick one: Java, C++ or Go. Do 100% of interview practice in it.
Ramp in 2–3 weeks: syntax, collections, string APIs, sorting, PriorityQueue/heap, maps/sets, custom comparators, and I/O.
Targets: no IDE/autocomplete; compile mentally; write bug‑free medium in ≤20 min.
Algorithms depth and volume

Coverage: arrays/strings, hash maps/sets, two pointers, sliding window, linked lists, stacks/queues, trees/BST, graphs (BFS/DFS, topological, SCC), heaps, intervals, binary search patterns, recursion/backtracking, greedy, union‑find, shortest paths (Dijkstra/Bellman‑Ford), tries, DP (1D/2D, knapsack, LIS/LCS, tree/graph DP), string algos (KMP/Z/rolling hash), math/mod, probability basics.
Volume targets (unique solved):
By week 12: 75 mediums + 15 hards
By week 24: 150 mediums + 40 hards
By week 36: 220–300 total (incl. 60–80 hards across topics)
Speed targets: easy ≤10 min, medium ≤20 min, hard ≤35 min; space/time analysis before coding.
Drills: 3 problems/day on weekdays; 1–2 hards on weekend; 2 timed mocks/week in the last 8 weeks.
System design (SDE2 depth)

Foundations: consistency models; transactions and isolation; indexing (B‑tree/LSM), storage engines; caching tiers; sharding/partitioning; replication (leader/follower, quorum); message queues; idempotency/exactly‑once myths; backpressure; rate limiting; tail latency; SLO/error budgets.
Build 12+ end‑to‑end designs: URL shortener, news feed, chat, search autocomplete, logging pipeline, object storage, rate limiter, payments flow, analytics counter, video streaming, notifications, doc collaboration.
For each: requirements, APIs, data model, capacity estimates, partitioning/replication, consistency and failure handling, back‑of‑envelope numbers, risks/trade‑offs.
Practice 1 full design/week in the final 12 weeks; 4 live mocks before interviews.
CS fundamentals polish

OS/Concurrency: threads vs async, locks, deadlocks, scheduling, memory hierarchy, CPU cache effects.
Networking: TCP/TLS, HTTP/2+3, gRPC; connection pooling; head‑of‑line blocking; Nagle/Delayed ACKs (awareness).
Databases: indexing strategies, query plans, transactions (2PC/Sagas), hot partitions.
Behavioral/GCA

Structure answers with STAR; emphasize ownership, debugging under ambiguity, impact, cross‑team collaboration, mentorship (SDE2 signal).
Keep a log of 12–16 stories mapped to categories: leadership, conflict, failure, delivery under pressure, data‑driven decisions.
8‑week pre‑interview sprint overlay (use this ahead of loops)

Mon–Fri (2–3 h/day): 2 mediums + 1 hard timed; 20 min review/refactor; 15 min flashcards (patterns, edge cases).
3 days/week: 30 min system design micro‑drill (one subproblem: rate limiting, secondary index, write amplification).
Weekend: 1 full system design mock (45–60 min) + 2 hards; write a 1‑page design doc.
Weekly: 1 live coding mock + 1 live design mock with feedback; track solve time and error rate.
Readiness rubric (use as a gate)

Coding
≥90% of blind mediums ≤20 min, ≤1 bug; ≥60% of hards ≤35 min.
250±50 unique problems total with balanced topic histogram (no topic <5%).
System design
Can drive a 45–60 min design with clear requirements, numbers, trade‑offs; no major gaps on consistency/backpressure/sharding.
10+ well‑written design docs with capacity estimates.
Communication
States approach, alternatives, and tests before coding; probes constraints; narrates trade‑offs.
Behavioral
12+ STAR stories; concise 2–3 min narratives; clear lessons/impact.
Suggested resources (keep it focused)

Coding/DSA
NeetCode 150 + LeetCode Top 100 Liked + Graphs/DP/Hard lists; LeetCode Premium for filters.
CP‑Algorithms (reference), EPI or CTCI for patterns.
System design
Designing Data‑Intensive Applications (DDIA), System Design Interview Vol. 1–2 (use as scaffolding), ByteByteGo visuals, Donne Martin’s System Design Primer.
Fundamentals
Networking: High Performance Browser Networking (relevant chapters), Beejs’ guides.
OS: OSTEP selected chapters (processes, scheduling, concurrency).
Mocks
Pramp/Interviewing.io/peer mocks; record and review.
How to adapt your existing 36‑week plan

Keep your project/FS phases for portfolio and practical skills.
Add a daily DSA slot (45–90 min) on Mon–Fri and expand Day‑6 interview prep to 2–3 hours with 1–2 hards + 1 design micro‑drill.
Replace 25–32 (cloud deep dives) with a heavier algorithms block if you’re under the DSA targets.
Switch all interview practice to Java/C++/Go by Week 6 at the latest.
Bottom line

With the added deltas (language switch, DSA volume/speed, deeper design, deliberate mocks), this plan is strong enough to hit the Google SDE2 bar for many teams.
Without those deltas, it’s excellent for full‑stack roles but may fall short on algorithmic speed and SDE2‑level design depth typically expected at Google.
If you share your chosen language and current problem counts/times, I can tailor a precise 8‑week sprint and a topic‑balanced problem set next.
